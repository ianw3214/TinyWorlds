***

<TINY WORLDS> is a Hack n Slash / Beat em Up style game with a short storyline along with the gameplay. The art style is
similar to that of Ori and the Blond forest or Journey, but in 2D. 

The player will fight the monsters in each world, a.k.a. the fears of each different person. Once the player has beaten 
enough monsters, he/she will advance to the next level until reaching the final level which is the mind of the main
character. Each level may have boss fights if there is enough time to implement them. 

Tools:
  - Visual Studio (programming)
  - Photoshop (Art)
  - Spine (Animation)
  - Bosca Ceoil (Music)
  - ChipTune (SFX)
